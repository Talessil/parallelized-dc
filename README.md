 *Parallel Graph Partitioning Approach to Enhance Community Detection in Social Networks

This is a new parallel partitioning algorithm with a focus on assisting in community detection in social networks. The algorithm uses a subtree-splitting strategy, as well as boundaries defined, in order to cut the network into 'n' balanced  subnetworks. The algorithm considers two particulars: (i) keeps the partitions connectivity, and; (ii) allows node overlapping between partitions.
